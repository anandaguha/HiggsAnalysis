The current direcotry/file structure for my code

Python (csv -> ordered csv code):
  The directories will be split into energy levels and order in pertubation *if* it is LO in the pertubation 
  then there will be another splitting based on as 130 or 118.
  Examples: ('ParentDirectory'/SQRT1300/LO/as_130, or 'ParentDirectory'/SQRT1300/LO/as_118, or 'ParentDirectory'/SQRT1300/NLO)

  For the file structure H_PDFValue_smur_smuf_smallx(0,1)_#particleDecayedInto (0,1,2,3)
  Examples: H_0_0.25_0.5_0_2: This is uses PDF 0, mur of 0.25, muf of 0.5, uses correction w/o small x, contains only top and bottom. 
  
  Also please delte all the files created before running the code again, my code appends to the files if they exisit so if you dont 
  delte the files when you run the code again it will just add the data to alredy existing data, instead of rewriting the data.
